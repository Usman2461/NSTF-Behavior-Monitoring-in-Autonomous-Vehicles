Finalized Symbolic Rules (R1 to R8):

R1: If the vehicle fails to stop at a red light AND there are no other vehicles moving, THEN a violation is detected, prompting an immediate classification of the maneuver as unsafe.

R2: If the vehicle is too close to another object AND it is not braking, THEN a violation is detected.

R3: If the vehicle is exceeding the speed limit AND the road type is residential, THEN a violation is detected.

R4: If the vehicle is within a lane but the turn signal is not active, THEN a violation is detected.

R5: If the vehicle is speeding AND the road type is residential, THEN a violation is detected.

R6: If the vehicle is too close to the next vehicle AND there is no safe following distance, THEN a violation is detected.

R7: If the vehicle is performing an unsafe lane change without activating the turn signal, THEN a violation is detected, prompting the symbolic reasoning engine to trigger two critical outcomes: (1) the maneuver is formally classified as a behavioral violation, and (2) a comprehensive explanation trace is recorded for subsequent auditing.

R8: If the vehicle is approaching a pedestrian crosswalk, AND visibility is limited (due to fog, rain, or nighttime driving conditions), AND pedestrian cues are unclear, THEN the vehicle should execute a precautionary stop.




Extra Symbolic Rules (R9 to R28):

R9: If the vehicle is speeding AND there is a sharp turn ahead, THEN a violation is detected, as the vehicle should decelerate for safety.

R10: If the vehicle is traveling in the wrong direction on a one-way street, THEN a violation is detected.

R11: If the vehicle is over-speeding in a school zone, THEN a violation is detected, triggering a warning for potential child presence.

R12: If the vehicle is changing lanes abruptly without proper signal AND there are other vehicles in proximity, THEN a violation is detected.

R13: If the vehicle blocks an intersection while the light is green (for cross traffic), THEN a violation is detected.

R14: If the vehicle fails to yield to a pedestrian at a crosswalk, THEN a violation is detected.

R15: If the vehicle is driving too closely to a cyclist, AND the vehicle’s speed is above 45 km/h, THEN a violation is detected, suggesting unsafe distance.

R16: If the vehicle is in a no parking zone, THEN a violation is detected.

R17: If the vehicle disregards a stop sign, even if the intersection is clear, THEN a violation is detected.

R18: If the vehicle is exceeding the speed limit AND there is heavy rain or snow, THEN a violation is detected due to reduced visibility.

R19: If the vehicle is not signaling for a lane change, AND there is a vehicle in the adjacent lane, THEN a violation is detected.

R20: If the vehicle is turning left at a red light, AND there is no dedicated left turn lane, THEN a violation is detected.

R21: If the vehicle is in the wrong lane for the direction of travel at an intersection, THEN a violation is detected.

R22: If the vehicle is driving in a bus lane during restricted hours, THEN a violation is detected.

R23: If the vehicle is speeding AND the road is wet or slippery, THEN a violation is detected, as it increases risk.

R24: If the vehicle is approaching a school bus with its lights flashing, and the vehicle does not stop, THEN a violation is detected.

R25: If the vehicle is not maintaining a safe distance from emergency vehicles with lights flashing, THEN a violation is detected.

R26: If the vehicle does not stop for a red flashing pedestrian signal, THEN a violation is detected.

R27: If the vehicle is turning left without checking for oncoming traffic, THEN a violation is detected.

R28: If the vehicle is speeding in construction zones and the worker presence is detected, THEN a violation is detected.
